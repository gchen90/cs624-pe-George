# Process

# Output
This app uses ScrollView, Image, View, Text, TextInput, StyleSheet components.
Views are used to wrap related Text and TextInput elements together, and a
ScrollView wraps all the elements so they can all be scrolled through. A
StyleSheet is used to maintain a consistent style for headers and normal
text. Finally, TouchableOpacity, and Linking components are used to show
a hyperlink leading to the course catalog.
